## Required Files

### alarm-sound.mp3

You need to add an alarm sound file named `alarm-sound.mp3` to this directory for the alarm challenges to work properly.

The sound file should be:

- MP3 format
- Suitable for waking users up
- Not too harsh but effective
- Loopable

You can use any royalty-free alarm sound or generate one using tools like:

- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com
- Or any audio generation tool

## Other Assets

Additional assets like challenge reference images, sleep sounds, etc. can be added here as the app develops.
